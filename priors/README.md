# priors

MCMC algorithms for implementing Dirichlet process priors

- **dp.prior.mcmc.R**: Fit Dirichlet process prior model (see Gelman et al. 2014, BDA Section 23.2). Note that this code needs to be vetted.
- **dp.prior.sim.R**: Simulate data according to model specification of dp.prior.mcmc.R. Note that this code needs to be vetted.
